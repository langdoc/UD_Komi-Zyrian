## Komi-Zyrian [Universal Dependency](universaldependencies.org) annotations

This is an experimental setup for Komi-Zyrian syntactic annotations. It is a part of a larger task to produce Komi-Zyrian gold corpus, and is primarily based into Public Domain data. However, a longer term goal is to include also spoken Komi-Zyrian data from [IKDP language documentation project](https://langdoc.github.io/IKDP).

The annotations are mainly done by [Niko Partanen](https://github.com/nikopartanen). They contain certainly numerous mistakes and reflect an early stage of Komi treebanks. The annotation work has been done in [LATTICE-CNRS](http://www.lattice.cnrs.fr/) laboratory in Paris.

Morphological annotations are created with [Giellatekno's](http://giellatekno.uit.no/) Komi-Zyrian morphological analysator, and Francis Tyers [vislcg3-to-conllx-input.py](https://github.com/ftyers/ud-scripts/blob/master/vislcg3-to-conllx-input.py) script is used to the output into CONLL-U format.

Some of the annotations have been taken from [this collection](http://ilazki.thinkgeek.co.uk/brat/#/uralic/kpv), with the understanding that this data is intended as publicly available.

This data was used in the paper [Partanen, N., Lim, K., Rie√üler, M., & Poibeau, T. (2018). Dependency Parsing of Code-Switching Data with Cross-Lingual Feature Representations. In Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Computatinal Linguistics of Uralic Languages (pp. 1-17).](https://sci-hub.tw/http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-0201).

In April 2017 the treebanks used were moved into Universal Dependencies repository, where all further work will be done. Spoken data was included in treebank [IKDP](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Komi_Zyrian-IKDP), and standard is in treebank [LATTICE](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Komi_Zyrian-lattice).
