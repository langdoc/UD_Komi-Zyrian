## Komi-Zyrian Universal Dependency annotations

This is an experimental setup for Komi-Zyrian syntactic annotations. It is a part of a larger task to produce Komi-Zyrian gold corpus, and is primarily based into Public Domain data. However, a longer term goal is to include also spoken Komi-Zyrian data from [IKDP language documentation project](https://langdoc.github.io/IKDP).

The annotations are mainly done by [Niko Partanen](https://github.com/nikopartanen), and they certainly contain numerous errors as the author has just been learning recently how this annotation model works. If you notice mistakes, please open an issue or edit the file directly.

<!-- Some of the annotations have been taken from [this collection](http://ilazki.thinkgeek.co.uk/brat/#/uralic/kpv), the exact references of which have to be clarified soon -->
